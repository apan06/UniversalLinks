# UniversalLinks
Simple app with UIWebView and WKWebView that shows links to twitter.com. It is expected that both components will use universal links introduced in iOS 9 to show Twitter app installed.

# Install
Just clone a repo and press run on device with iOS 9 and Twitter app installed.

# Problem
This app illustrates the problem with Universal links:
1. UIWebView component will open Twitter app using Universal Links mechanism.
2. WKWebView component will open Twitter page
